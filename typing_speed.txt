I started touch typing on 23rd October 2019. I started at a speed of 5wpm.
Ten months later on 29th August 2020. I am now typing at an average speed of 80wpm. with an accuracy of 97%.
Thanks to typeracer.com for making my speed drastically increase will collaboration of all other typists around the universe who participate in typeracer.com.
My role model typist is sean_wrona who currently types at an average speed of 200wpm with 100% accuracy.
I aspire to type at an average speed of 140wpm two years to come and with practice i know i can even be as good as sean_wrona in typing.
once again THANK YOU typeracer.com
